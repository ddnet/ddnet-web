I'm happy to present you this year's Christmas Tournament, the Brutal (★★★★✰) map "Arctic Frost" by [Silex](/mappers/Silex/), [Im 'corneum](/mappers/Im-32--39-corneum/) & [louis](/mappers/louis/):

[<img class="demo" src="/Arctic_Frost.png" />](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7053)

The Tournament will be played next week on Sunday, December 20 at 18:00 CET (not this Sunday) on special Tournament servers in every DDNet location. No one has seen the map yet and the first finish will win! Team 0 is allowed.

Thanks to [Cøke](/mappers/C-248-ke/), [Ravie](/mappers/Ravie) & [DarkOort](/mappers/DarkOort) for testing the map! Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7053). The results will later be available on the [tournament page](/tournaments/53/).
