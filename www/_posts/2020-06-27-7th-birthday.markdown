DDNet is turning seven years old soon and I'm proud to present to you another Summer Tournament. This time we are playing on a map that compiles the best of 7 years of DDNet history! Over 130 parts from 59 maps by 45 different mappers!

[<img class="demo" src="/Patchwork.png" />](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=6944)

Join us on **Saturday** (not Sunday!), **July 11 at 18:00 CEST** (2 hours earlier than our usual time!) to play the brand-new Moderate (★★★★★) map Patchwork by [Cøke](/mappers/C-248-ke/), [Tridemy](/mappers/Tridemy/) & [Qywinc](/mappers/Qywinc) on every official DDNet server around the world. May the first team to finish win!

Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=6944).
