The nightly build of DDNet from its [source code](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/) has been revived:

<a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-win32.zip">Windows&nbsp;32bit</a>, <a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-win64.zip">Windows&nbsp;64bit</a>, <a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-linux_x86.tar.xz">Linux&nbsp;x86</a>, <a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-linux_x86_64.tar.xz">Linux&nbsp;x86_64</a>, <a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-osx.dmg">Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</a>

You can use these nightly builds to try out new DDNet features before they're released and report problems and suggestions. The nightly client does not auto-update, instead you will get a notification when a new regular DDNet version has been released.

You can also opt into the beta release of DDraceNetwork on Steam to automatically get a new test version every day.

Please report any problems you have with the nightly build on our [Discord](https://ddnet.tw/discord) or directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/).
