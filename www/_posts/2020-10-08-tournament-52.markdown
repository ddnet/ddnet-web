On short notice I'm happy to present you another DDNet Tournament, the Moderate (★★✰✰✰) map "UpNDown Coop" by [Vasten100](/mappers/Vasten100/):

[<img class="demo" src="/UpNDown_Coop.png" />](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=6998)

The Tournament will be played on Sunday, October 11 at 20:00 CEST on special Tournament servers in every DDNet location. No one has seen the map yet and the best time after 90 minutes will win!

Thanks to [Welf](/mappers/Welf/) & [Cøke](/mappers/C-248-ke/) for testing the map! Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=6998). The results will later be available on the [tournament page](/tournaments/52/).
