We haven't had a tournament in a while, so let's try something special: In the next tournament playing in Team 0 will be allowed! So we will have pro teams competing against big groups in Team 0!

The Tournament will happen on Sunday, March 19 at 20:00 CET on Konsti's Brutal map Shockwave. The first team to finish wins! Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=4954).
