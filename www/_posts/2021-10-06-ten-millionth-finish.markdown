On Thursday, September 30 DDNet reached its ten millionth finish. It was by [MaKaBaKa](https://ddnet.tw/players/MaKaBaKa/) on the map [Cool](https://ddnet.tw/maps/Cool/) on 2021-09-30 14:26:48 UTC+2.

As you can see in the diagram above, the number of finishes grew faster since the Steam release, with the five millionth happening not even a year earlier on 2020-10-31 20:59:22 UTC+2 by [MrAFK](https://ddnet.tw/players/MrAFK/) on [Impulse_01](https://ddnet.tw/maps/Impulse-95-01).
