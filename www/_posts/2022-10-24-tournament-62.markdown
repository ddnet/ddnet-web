It's time for the fourth tournament of the year! We will play the brand-new Brutal (★★★★★) map Behemoth 2 by [Pulsar](https://ddnet.org/mappers/Pulsar/), [Ravie](https://ddnet.org/mappers/Ravie/) & [Sorah](https://ddnet.org/mappers/Sorah/):

The Tournament will be played on Sunday, October 30 at 18:00 CET (summer time end on same day!) on special Tournament servers in every DDNet location! No one has seen the map yet and the first finish will win!

Thanks to [Pipou](/mappers/Pipou/) for testing the map! Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=114&t=7537). The results will later be available on the [Tournament page](/tournaments/62/).
