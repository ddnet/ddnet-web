On August 21 DDNet 11.4 was released with a server bug that made some tiles have no effect. As of 22:50 on August 23 the official servers were rebooted with the new version 11.4.1 (skipping 11.4) that had the same bug. The effect was that players since then could finish maps much easier and as we saw on [Discord](https://ddnet.tw/discord) this was widely abused immediately:

This morning at 09:40 we fixed the bug and released DDNet 11.4.2 with a new version and immediately force-restarted all servers. Since this bug made most maps significantly easier to finish all ranks and saves made between 2018-08-23 22:50 CEST and 2018-08-24 09:40 CEST had to be deleted.

If you are running your own server and updated it to DDNet 11.4 or 11.4.1 already, make sure to update the server immediately and remove affected ranks and saves.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
