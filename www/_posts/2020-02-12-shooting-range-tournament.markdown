I'm happy to present you the second DDNet Tournament of 2020, the Fun map Shooting Range by [Im 'corneum](/mappers/Im-32--39-corneum/) & [Soapy Sandwich](/mappers/Soapy-32-Sandwich/):

The Tournament will be played on Sunday, February 16 at 20:00 CET. The best finish time after 30 minutes wins! The map is not really a DDRace map, but rather a Fun map that can be played alone and requires aiming skills.

Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=6906).
