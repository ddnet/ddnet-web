I have recently improved some parts of to the DDNet website:

- The [Ranks pages](/ranks/) now show server country and server type where it makes sense and "Last Finishes" can be expanded to 500 entries
- The Maps page loads faster now, especially on maps with many finishes, for example [Kobra 2](/maps/Kobra-32-2)
- The [Statistics page](/stats/) looks nicer and loads more historical data now
