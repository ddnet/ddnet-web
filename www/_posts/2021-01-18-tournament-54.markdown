I'm happy to present you this year's first Tournament, the Race (★★★✰✰) map "Knux" by [Knuski](/mappers/Knuski/):

[<img class="demo" src="/Knux.png" />](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7077)

The Tournament will be played on Sunday, January 24 at 20:00 CET on special Tournament servers in every DDNet location. No one has seen the map yet and the best time after 90 minutes will win! Since it's a Race map the map is played alone.

Thanks to [louis](/mappers/louis/) & [ReD](/mappers/ReD/) for testing the map! Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7077). The results will later be available on the [tournament page](/tournaments/54/).
