DDNet is now 3 years old and that means it's time for another big tournament this weekend, on August 6 and 7!

You can choose to participate in one or multiple parts of this big tournament. I hope we have something in there for everyone. Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&p=42062).
