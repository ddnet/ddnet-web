It's time for the second tournament of the year! We will play the brand-new Brutal (★★★★✰) map Simple Down by Zweitleben:

The Tournament will be played on Sunday, March 13 at 18:00 CET on special Tournament servers in every DDNet location! No one has seen the map yet and the first finish will win! The map can be finished in a team as well as in team 0.

Thanks to [Pipou](/mappers/Pipou/), [Knuski](/mappers/Knuski/), [Cøke](/mappers/C-248-ke/) for testing the map! Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7408). The results will later be available on the [Tournament page](/tournaments/60/).
