DDNet is six years old and that means ... it's time for DDNet to go to school. Also, we'll have a tournament ready that will get your brain ducked!

[<img class="demo" src="/_uploads/brainduck2.png" />](//forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=6841)

Join us on Sunday, August 18th at 20:00 CEST to play the brand-new Brutal map brainduck2 by ٭ıƞdex'<3 & Rapture on every official DDNet server around the world. May the first team to finish win!
