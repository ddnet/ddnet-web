I'm happy to present you this year's second Tournament, the Solo (★✰✰✰✰) map "Moventer" by [Themix](/mappers/Themix/):

[<img class="demo" src="/_uploads/Moventer.png" />](//forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7113)

The Tournament will be played on Sunday, April 4 at 20:00 CEST on special Tournament servers in every DDNet location. No one has seen the map yet and the best time after 60 minutes will win! Since it's a Solo map the map is played alone.

Thanks to [Ravie](/mappers/Ravie/), [Kicker](/mappers/Kicker) & [Lady Saavik](/mappers/Lady-32-Saavik/) for testing the map! Discussion on the [forum](//forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7113). The results will later be available on the [tournament page](/tournaments/55/).
