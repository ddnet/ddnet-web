It's time for the first tournament of the year! We will play the brand-new Brutal (★★★★★) map Naufrage 4 by [SickCunt](https://ddnet.org/mappers/SickCunt/) & [panik](https://ddnet.org/mappers/panik/):

The Tournament will be played on Sunday, Feburary 23 at 18:00 CET on special Tournament servers in every DDNet location! No one has seen the map yet and the first finish will win!

Thanks to [meloƞ](/players/melo-414-/), [Kicker](/mappers/Kicker/), [Knuski](/mappers/Knuski/) & [♂S1mple♂](/players/-9794-S1mple-9794-/) for testing the map! The results will later be available on the [Tournament page](/tournaments/63/).
