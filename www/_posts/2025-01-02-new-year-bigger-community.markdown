As we welcome 2025, we want to take a moment to thank our amazing community for all the support throughout the past year. Our community has once again grown massively in size, and we couldn't be more excited to see new players join the fun.

A massive thank you to all the talented mappers, testers, developers, content creators, and artists who’ve poured their time and creativity into making DDNet better with every update. Our deepest gratitude also goes to all moderators who keep our servers in check and welcoming for everyone.

And lastly, we also want to express our heartfelt appreciation to those who have generously supported our project through donations. As DDNet continues to grow, so do our server costs. Last year's donations weren't enough to fully cover [last year’s expenses](https://ddnet.org/funding/), but we remain committed to improving and growing DDNet. If you’re able to contribute, no matter the amount, it would mean the world to us and help us continue building a vibrant and exciting future for DDNet.

We’re also kicking off the year with the annual DDNet Photoshoot event! [Join us](https://ddnet.org/connect-to/?addr=176.9.114.238:8297/) and the community to capture your tee on this year's map. There are plenty of spots for everyone, so bring your friends and take part in the fun! (Pssst, there may even be some secrets hidden around for those who want a cooler shot.) To get a better idea, check out last year’s photoshoots from [2024](https://ddnet.org/newyear2024/), [2023](https://ddnet.org/newyear2023/), and [2022](https://ddnet.org/newyear2022/).

With gratitude,
The DDraceNetwork Team
