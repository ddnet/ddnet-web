We have just suggested [DDraceNetwork to Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506147661).

[<img class="demo" src="/_uploads/ddnet-to-greenlight.svg" />](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506147661)

Now we need your support to get DDNet accepted, so that it can be released on Steam! You can also leave a nice comment about why you think DDNet should be on Steam.

Hopefully this will give DDNet new, enthusiastic players. It would also be nice to have for all the existing DDNet players who want to use it on Steam.

Discuss this [on the forum](//forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2125).
