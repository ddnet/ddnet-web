Recently the @DDNet bot on the official [DDNet Discord server](https://ddnet.org/discord) has been extended by jao.

- `$profile <player>` shows a player's points, teamrank points and rank points:

For the new `$profile` and `$map` feature thanks to Oblikumquat for coding help, Ravie for drawing the game-tiles, Freezestyler for selecting the backgrounds and everyone who tested and suggested ideas. Thanks to Ryozuki for coding help for the info channel server statistics.
