As you might have noticed a new cheat has been discovered with Skepâ€ icism. getting an impossibly good time on the Solo map Escape:

This bug has existed on DDNet for a long time and enabled one to play without solo mode on solo maps by following these easy steps:

1. `/map 4nubs`
2. Call vote -> Solo Maps
3. `/map 4nubs`
4. Call vote -> Random Solo Map Unfinished

It has been quick-fixed now and all official DDNet servers should be safe from this again. The affected ranks from yesterday have been deleted. If you find similar bugs still working please report them to me privately.

heinrich5991 is now using Teehistorian to analyze all runs of the last years to find cases where this bug has been abused before. Read [part two](/news/solo-cheat-ii).
