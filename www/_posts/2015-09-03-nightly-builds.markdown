DDNet now offers nightly builds, built every night at 03:15 CEST of the current DDNet source code as it's available [on Github](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/):

<a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-win32.zip">Windows&nbsp;32bit</a>, <a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-win64.zip">Windows&nbsp;64bit</a>, <a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-linux_x86.tar.xz">Linux&nbsp;x86</a>, <a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-linux_x86_64.tar.xz">Linux&nbsp;x86_64</a>, <a href="/downloads/DDNet-nightly-osx.dmg">Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</a>

You can use these nightly builds to try out new DDNet features before they're released and report problems and suggestions. The nightly client does not auto-update each night, instead you will get a notification when a new regular DDNet version has been released.
