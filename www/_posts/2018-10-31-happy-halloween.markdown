DDNet celebrates Halloween! Enjoy the dark website theme by Soreu.
It's a good time to have fun with your friends on our servers, so <a href="/skins/index.php?search=halloween">get dressed up</a> and join one of the DDNet Halloween servers in all locations with popular maps redesigned by Lady Saavik.
