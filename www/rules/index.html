<div class="block">
  <h1 id="mapping-rules">üìÑ Mapping Rules</h1>
  <p>
    If you want your map to be released on DDNet, you must follow these rules.
    Before you submit your map on <a href="/discord/">DDNet Discord</a>, make
    sure it is already thoroughly tested by you and your friends, parts work
    smoothly, and the design is finished!
  </p>

  <h2>üéÆ Gameplay general rules</h2>

  <h4>1. Start and finish line</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>1.1 Start line</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>No startline skips. All tees have to cross the startline.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>1.2 Finish line</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You must allow the finish line to be reachable from the winner room so
          that a team may still finish if the last one dies. Make sure players
          have a chance to help others after finishing.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Time CPs</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your map must have time CPs (<a href="https://ddnet.org/explain/game/"
        >index 35-59</a
      >). They compare your current race time with your record time at a same
      checkpoint when crossing them.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Bugs</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ensure that your map doesn't include any of the listed
      <a href="https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=5137">bugs</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Functional gameplay</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your start area should be big enough for at least 10 players to start.
      Also, Make sure to place multiple map spawns off the ground.
      <strong>**</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Small part skips are permitted, provided they do not undermine the
      intended purpose of the part.
    </li>
    <p><strong>** Does not apply to Solo maps.</strong></p>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Fake tiles</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Don't use any "fake entities". Players have to be able to fully understand
      a map when using overlay entities. This also includes easter eggs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Marking</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Every entity that the player should know about should likewise be clearly
      marked with a visible tile.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Naming your map</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You should make sure that your map's name isn't similar to an existing map
      on DDNet. Check the availabilities at
      <a href="https://ddnet.org/releases/">Map search</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üóÉÔ∏è Hosting & Server Type Rules</h2>

  <h4>üåê Hosting rules</h4>
  <ul>
    <p>Hosting publicly accessible servers requires them to be registered with Teeworlds' and DDNet master servers.
      Game servers that register with these master servers are subject to <a href="https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=rules/server_rules">the server hosting rules of Teeworlds</a> as well as the additional DDNet rules:</p>
    <li>A modified Teeworlds server must not use a standard gametype (dm, tdm, ctf, lms, lts)</li>
    <li>0.6.x and previous: The player count shown must resemble the amount of human players. The maximum player count must be the maximum number of human players.</li>
    <li>0.7.x and later: You can also include non-human players using a special bot flag. This allows client-side filtering.</li>
    <li>Do not host an excessive amount of servers. There is no fixed limit but try to not overdo it. (i.e. there should be people playing on them eventually)</li>
    <li>Do not host servers purely for advertising purposes (e.g. passworded & having only an advertisement as name; having sponsoring info or the likes in the server name is perfectly fine).</li>
    <li>Do not advertise cheats (in i.e. message of the day, server messages, server name, through NPCs, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
  Servers violating this ruleset will be banned.

  <h4>üë∂ Novice maps</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Faily parts should be rare in Novice maps.</li>
    <li>Novice maps should not contain any faily solo parts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>üë¥ Oldschool maps</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The map is finishable.</li>
    <li>
      The map doesn't contain big cheats leading to 20-100% of the map being
      cheated.
    </li>
    <li>The difficulty isn't unbalanced.</li>
    <li>
      There are no visual bugs. Every tile has to be marked properly. Fix color
      issues (clashing or bright colors).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>‚ôø Dummy maps</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make sure deepfly is off unless it's necessary to complete the map (if the
      gameplay revolves around the use of deepfly). Inside the editor, go to
      "Server settings" and write "sv_deepfly 0". Deepfly allows you to fly with
      your dummy, even if he's deep frozen; therefore it can lead to cheats.
    </li>
    <li>
      Verify that the deep isn't skippable. Look at our current dummy maps to
      see how it's done properly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add an unlock team tile before the player has to kill their dummy so that
      the actual player isn't killed as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure that you can't reach the finish line with the dummy. Team ranks
      are not allowed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>üèÅ Race maps</h4>
  <ul>
    <p>DDNet is focused around DDRace but we host a few race maps.</p>
    <li>
      Before posting it on DDNet, ensure that the map doesn't already exist on
      <a href="https://uniqueclan.net/maps">Unique</a>. **
    </li>
    <li>
      Race maps can only use Race tiles, thus contain the following tiles:
      hookable, unhookable, teleport, kill, grenade, time CPs, start and finish
      line.
    </li>
    <p>
      ** Unique is a Race community and we do not intend to compete with them.
      Occasionally, we allow a few rare but good race maps to provide players
      with the opportunity to discover and enjoy such content, as our community
      is dispersed across the world, unlike Unique.
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h4>üöÄ Solo maps</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>"sv_solo_server 1" must be set as map setting.</li>
    <li>
      Spawn, totele and ctotele tiles must be placed on the ground. Only place 1
      spawn and only 1 totele or ctotele per tele.
    </li>
    <li>Noob filters are forbidden.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>üéâ Fun maps</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Those maps do not need to contain a start and a finish line, nor time CPs.
    </li>
  </ul>
