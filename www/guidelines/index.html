  <h1 id="mapping-guidelines">📏📐 Mapping Guidelines</h1>
  <p>
    For your map to find its way onto DDNet, these guidelines are here to assist
    you. While they aren't mandatory rules, we recommend considering them before
    submitting your creation on the
    <a href="/discord/">DDNet Discord</a>. Taking the time to test your map
    thoroughly with yourself and friends, ensuring smooth functionality, and
    polishing the design can greatly enhance its overall quality. The guidelines
    are here as a helpful resource to optimize your submission.
  </p>

  <h2>🎮 Gameplay</h2>
  <h4>1. Consistent difficulty</h4>
  <p>
    Large spikes in difficulty lead to an unbalanced gameplay ; too easy or too
    hard at times, it’s unsatisfying for players and it’s impossible for testers
    to rate during the testing process.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your map should be balanced throughout the whole map - don't put a Brutal
      part in the middle of a Moderate map.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Nice and clean</h4>
  <p>
    Special tiles shouldn't be overused, used if they're not needed or used to
    fix cheats. Avoid situations with e.g. speed ups + deep + infinite hook +
    jump refill + tele gun + stoppers...
    <br /><br />
    Special tiles are anything but hookable, unhookable, freeze, unfreeze, and
    death.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The gameplay can't be intentionally misleading or confusing.</li>
    <li>The gameplay can be hard but it should be easy to read.</li>
    <li>
      The structure of the map should help read the gameplay when zooming out.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Recoverability - situational</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It depends on the style of the map but in general, in parts where it's
      easy to fail, there should be ways to recover.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Claustrophobia</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>4.1. Spawn</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your start area should be big enough for at least 10 players to start.
          Make sure to place multiple map spawns
          <strong>off the ground</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4.2. Parts & transitions</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>There has to be enough space in parts for comfortable movement.</li>
        <li>
          Unless the map is team locked, there should be enough room for
          everyone in t0.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4.3. Platforms</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can save room and avoid blocking by adding platforms or hookable
          tiles.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>❗ Too much space can be overwhelming.</p>

  <h4>5. Equitable</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You should give fair amounts of play time for each player in a map (if one
      player does a long part, then so should the other). Also, in general,
      avoid making parts that require players to wait for excessive amounts of
      time.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Teleport</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>6.1. From</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure that every teleporter is red (which will stop player movement
          and cut their hook) unless you intend to use blue teleporters to
          retain hook and movement.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>6.2. TeleCPs</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>There has to be enough space in parts for comfortable movement.</li>
        <li>
          They shouldn't be skipped or missed. They should also be well placed,
          see G10.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>6.3. (C)TOTele</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For every teleporter, ensure that there are multiple (C)TO-tiles and
          that they are not placed directly on the ground.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Spam</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Avoid chat-spam caused by carelessly placed on/off-tiles as well as
      gametile-spam.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>8. Team size</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Only force a certain team size if the map requires it (e.g. if it contains
      a lot switches, is heavy cheatable with many players), not as an excuse
      for tight mapping.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎮 Design Guidelines</h2>

  <h4>1. Colors and contrasts</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The design must have appropriate contrast so that it's playable even
      without perfect light conditions. On the other hand, it shouldn't be
      painful to look at.
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid too small color variations for gradient or it will lead to color
      banding.
    </li>
    <li>
      There has to be a clear distinction between foreground and background
      elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      Contrast and saturation shouldn't be too high so the map isn't an eyesore.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Unused</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>2.1. Images</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure that every teleporter is red (which will stop player movement
          and cut their hook) unless you intend to use blue teleporters to
          retain hook and movement.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2.2. Groups and layers</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure there are no unused images (marked as dark blue in the
          'Images' tab of the editor), mistakenly embedded or external images
          (marked as red). Also, don't add the same image more than once.
        </li>
        <li>Check for empty, unused groups and layers.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2.3. Envelopes</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Remove all the unused envelopes. A green envelope means it can be
          removed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Image format</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your images should respect the "Power of two" rule. The size should be
      [..., 64px, 128px, 256px, 512px, 1024px, ...]. It helps with performances,
      rendering, compatibility and compression. Make your images as small as
      possible until they start becoming blurry.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Layer size</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ensure that layers aren't too big. When your map is finished make the
      layers as small as possible (but don't cut off any parts).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Image format</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All non-gameplay relevant decorations should be marked as "detail" in the
      editor. Map credits are excluded. Sometimes it's good to keep a few
      cosmetic layers, so that the map doesn't look completely naked. Walls,
      freeze, other essential tiles and the background should never be HD.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Background</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ensure that the background is not transparent and is large enough for all
      screen resolutions (use the 'Proof' button in the editor to check what
      players will see; the area within the white borders has to be covered).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Entities off</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Always add an entities off sign if you put any information the player has
      to know about in the design (e.g. signs, text, or tips).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>8. Logo</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Map logos have to be behind the tees.</li>
  </ul>
